# Pegasus Notes

- [Installing themes](https://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes/)
    - On android 11+ access restricted to <storage>/Android/data/org.pegasus\_frontend.android/files/pegasus-frontend/themes/.  Needed to connect my andtroid tablet to my laptop to access the folder and install themes from my laptop
    - Android doesn't like "inline css" in svg images. Have to convert them to atrributes using "svgo" and plugin "convertStyleToAttrs" (some still required manual editing, grep "\<style" and "class=")
