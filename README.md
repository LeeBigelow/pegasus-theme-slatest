# Slatest theme for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/)

This is forked from the [nicjansma](https://github.com/nicjansma/pegasus-theme-slate-es-de) slate theme.

So far I've added:

- Favorites Collection. Toggle a game's favorite status with the "F" key or filter button
- Last Played collection
- All Games collection
- Game Description can be focused and scrolled
- Game List regex Filter
- Use TAB, Shift-Tab, or Details button, to cycle focus
    - Up/Down when focused on Filter, Game Art, Favorite Button, or Launch Button changes the selected game and returns focus to the Game List
    - Select/Enter when focused on Game Description returns focus to Game List
- Focus Game Art then cycle through other images (if available) with Enter key or Select button
    - Swiping Left/Right on the game art now also cycles through the images
- Added mouse and touch gestures:
    - Collections View:
        - Swipe up on system info to switch to Details View
    - Details View:
        - Double Click on Game Title to launch
        - Swipe Down on the Header to switch to Collections View
        - Swipe Left/Right on the Header to change current colleciton
        - Swipe Left/Right, or Double Click, on Game Art to cycle through images
        - Footer help images provide their function on click (if possible)
- Converted svg css styles to line attributes for Android compatability
- Some layout tweaks for tablet use
- Included my Pegasus and Skyscraper notes so future me can remember what was going on

Notes:

- Tested system art with "dummy roms" and all-in-one `metadata.pegasus.txt`: [pegasus-frontend-dummy-roms](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-frontend-dummy-roms)
- Game art mixed image screenshots generated by: [Skyscraper](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraperr)
- The same carousel interface with a retro Commodore feel: [Pegasus Amiga Workbench Theme](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-theme-amiga-workbench)
---

This is a port of the [slate-es-de](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/tree/master/themes/slate-es-de) theme from EmulationStation-DE.

It's based off of work from [Mátyás Mustoha](https://github.com/mmatyas) for the [pegasus-theme-es2-simple](https://github.com/mmatyas/pegasus-theme-es2-simple/) theme.

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-theme-slatest/archive/master.zip) and extract to your [theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes). You can then select the theme in the settings menu of Pegasus.
